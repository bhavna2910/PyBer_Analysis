# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the city types- Urban, Suburban and Rural in which Pyber operated. Goal was to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
### Analysis from Deliverable-I
* From the dataframe, we saw that Urban cities had the most amount of rides and drivers and rural cities have the least. 
* Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
* Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.
* Suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.

As a result the city type "Urban" brings the most revenue as seen in the **Total Fares** column and "Rural" cities bring the least amount of revenue. However, upon looking at **Average Fare per Ride** column of the dataframe, we can see that Rural city types have the highest average fare per ride, meaning that there is a chance of more revenue in this city type for every ride increase compared to Urban city types wich has the lowest average fare per ride. Other metric that we can see in this dataframe is the **average fare per drive**r, from this data it can be seen that drivers in the rural city type make $55.49 per ride, whereas the drivers in urban areas make almost 3 times less per ride which is $16.57.

### Analysis from Deliverable-II
* A multiple line chart was also created to help us visualize and perform analysis of the Total Fares from January 1 2019 to April 29th 2019 for each of the city types.
In the time period plot for the total fare for each of the ciy types, it was oberved that **"Urban" city types had the highest total fares for all the weeks** and **rural areas had the least.** 
* It was also observed that the 3rd week of February has the highest total fares for each of the city type showing increased demand at that time. 
* Urban cities aslo seem to bring a lot of revenue between end of Feb and beginning of March.

## Summary

Based on my analysis, a few recommendations that can be provided to Pyber are:
* Increasing the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities.This can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.
* The suburban city type is the middle performing city type in all the metrics calculated, therefore more investments can be directed towards Urban and Rural city types, as this city type can continue and perform as it is doing currently for PyBer.
* Urban cities have the highest total fare and most amount of rides and therefore account for most of the revenue for the company. As a result this is the best performing city type and more investments should be continued to be made in this type to realize greater profits for PyBer in the future.
