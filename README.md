# PyBer_Analysis
##Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the city types- Urban, Suburban and Rural in which Pyber operated. Goal was to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

##Results
Upon analyzing data shared by Pyber, some inferences can be clearly drawn based statistical overview and visualizations created:
* Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
* Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.
* Suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.
* Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.
* The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides.

##Summary
Based on my analysis, a few recommendations that can be provided to Pyber are:
* Increasing the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities.This can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.
